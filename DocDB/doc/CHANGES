 Fix problem with cookies expiration date beyond end of unix time

 Fix bug where AddFiles would clear signatures regardless of users setting

8.7.1/8.7.2
 A bugfix in AddFiles (was crashing due to a syntax error) and performance
 enhancements related to Events (regression in 8.7.0)

8.7.0
 A new option allows special users to copy the signature list and whether
 those signatures have been made to be preserved or copied when metadata is
 updated. This is used for small or irrelevant changes that should not
 trigger a requirement to have the document re-signed. A hack for version 8;
 will be done right (added to the DB) in version 9.

 A new option when deleting an author to move all documents, etc. from the old
 author to an existing one (duplicates often occur).

 Links for iCal lists of meetings. This format works with many desktop and
 online calendars including Google calendar. Can be turned off by setting
 $Preferences{Components}{iCal}  = $FALSE; Three new perl modules are needed
 to support this: Data::ICal, Data::ICal::Entry::Event, and
 DateTime::Format::ICal Also make sure you do cvs update -d in the html area
 to pick up the right image and CSS files.

  Remove Edit and Confirm from the display for publicly viewable meetings

  Display sessions in calendar that are out of the bounds of a meeting.

  Fix bug where some people watching documents would not be notified. Those
  users should re-visit the Personal Account page, check it, and re-submit their
  notification preferences. Add back any watched documents that are missing.

  Add in the capability to update the DB info of documents via XML. The
  signature of AddDocument has changed, now must be called with

  Make safe search strings which could crash MySQL search function

  Add a new administration routine, BulkCertificateInsert which allows an admin
  insert new certificate users 12 at a time without the user having to apply.
  Linked from admin page.

  New files: BulkCertificateInsert & DBColumnSizes.pm

8.4.1

  Make some additional changes to XML uploading.

8.4.0

  Add a new routine, XMLUpload which takes XML in the same format (with some
  additions) as that output by ShowDocument and creates a new document or
  updates an existing one. See the instructions under "advanced users" for more
  information and CopyDocDB in scripts/examples for a script that will move
  documents from one DocDB to another preserving the meta-data

8.3.0

  Add the ability to make the user check a disclaimer box. See
  $Preferences{Options}{SubmitAgree} in Project/DocDBGlobals.pm

  For certificate version, add a script to be able to check which users
  are part of which group(s).

8.2.5

  Fix bug from 8.1 or 8.2 where whether existing author list was ordered or not
  was mis-detected.

8.2.4

  Fix bug from 8.2.0 where topics were not shown

8.2.1

  The only user-visible change is that when a document is modifiable or viewable
  by a group that can't actually view or modify documents, that fact is noted in
  the document view. Entering documents like this generates a message to the
  user but the update proceeds. See
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=830064&aid=1603989&group_id=164024
  for more information.

  Topic administration has been changed to eliminate some incomplete/wrong
  entries.

  MigrateV8 and  CreateDatabase.SQL have been changed so that they are
  compatible with more recent versions of MySQL. For more info see
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=640807

8.2.0

  DocDB now supports additional meta-information for events and sessions. A 2nd
  location (Alternate Location) field has been added for things like video
  conferencing numbers, virtual rooms, etc. Also, moderators (from the author
  list) and topics can be attached to both events and sessions and lists of
  events and sessions moderated by an author or on a topic can be retrieved. All
  of this information is shown on the event page if present.

  Add a new variable HTTP_ENCODING to allow DocDB to say it is unicode or other
  character encodings. Set automatically to ISO-8859-1 (default Latin alphabet)
  Change a bunch of header lines to enable this

8.1.4

  A bug in an unclosed tag on the topic table was fixed.

8.1.3

  Fix a problem with notifications for AllDocuments. The migrate script and the
  cgi code didn't agree on what value should be in a field. They are consistent
  now and a temporary patch (until version 9) has been added so that it works
  with both values.

  8.1.1 and 8.1.2 fix a couple of crashes related to missing require statements.

8.1.0

  Reminder, you must follow the Version 8.0 upgrade instructions at
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=605893 before updating from
  version 7.x. You can upgrade directly to any 8.x version, you needn't upgrade
  to 8.0.

  You can now specify the order of authors on a document. This is done by
  switching the author entry widget from a selectable list to the existing
  text-entry box. The method  can be selected by user preferences, the advanced
  entry form, or by clicking to switch from one method to the other on the
  document entry form (requires  Javascript). If a document with an ordered
  author list is modified, the text form is the default since the selectable list
  would destroy the list.

  The adminstrator only functions have been separated out into a separate page
  (AdminHome). A couple of the more common ones are duplicated on ModifyHome. For adminstrators
  AdminHome is linked from the main DocDB page as well as from the Modify page

  The instructions for the public pages can contain links to the private and secure pages IF
  additional values are declared in ProjectGlobals.pm (see ProjectGlobals.pm.template for a
  an example). These two variables are called "secure_root" and "PrivateRoot" This should allow
  confused users who somehow arrive at the public interface to find the private interface. Even if
  neither of these variables are defined, more explicit text is included in the instructions
  to try to handle this case.

8.0.1

  Fixed crash when "Change Display" is chosen with Public interface

  Restore document table for orphaned event documents for single session events
  Add # of documents orphaned to "Simple List" text

  Matched but unconfirmed session talks get italics again

  Fixed display of root level topics with no sub-topics

  Small change to CSS files, so update those as well

8.0.0

  Follow the migration instructions in MigrationGuide to upgrade.

  Set to separate view/modify lists by default. If you want the old behavior, put
  $EnhancedSecurity = $FALSE; in ProjectGlobals. This is backwards compatible with
  the old setting.

  DocDB now uses the Perl module CGI::Untaint. CGI::Untaint is used to "purify"
  the input into the scripts. You must install it. You can use scripts/CheckModules
  to see if you have all the modules you need for Version 8.x

  There is now a CanView option that you can set for a group to disable their
  access even if they are marked as a group that can view a particular
  document.  Groups without CanView set can still access DocDB, it will just
  show publicly  accessible documents. Groups that cannot View are prohibited
  from creating or  modifying documents too. This seems logical, but if there is
  a  good reason to change it, we can. This feature was thought to be useful
  for  disabling reviewer accounts between reviews.
  The user can still use DocDB, but can only see publicly accessible documents.

  Topics can now have sub-topics, sub-sub-topics, etc. Users can also select top
  level topics. Make sure the long description of a sub-topic is fully
  descriptive as often the long description is shown without the context of its
  parent topic. The maintainer can set the variable
  $Preferences{Topics}{MinLevel}{Document} so that users cannot select top-level
  (or 2nd level) topics for documents. The default value is 1, other values can
  be set in ProjectGlobals.pm.

  New files
    cgi/TopicUtilities.pm

7.7.0
  Reorganized the output of DisplayMeeting to look more like ShowDocument and
  to present things in a clearer manner.

  Add a routine in scripts to help find obsolete code. Remove a bunch of
  uncalled routines.

  Added XML output capability to ShowDocument

  Moved advanced user instructions to a separate page and added instructions for
  XML and mention of Perl "programatic" interface

  Allow external DocDB location to miss final "/" for XSearch

  Added instructions for admins.

  Added redirect to CertificateApplyForm after 5 seconds if the user is not verified.

  New Files:
    AdministerIntructions.pm
    AdvancedIntructions.pm

7.6.1
  New file: ListGroups Should be placed in public scripts directory too.

  Added a new script, ListGroups which lists the various security groups and
  allows the user to get a list of the documents viewable by that group. This
  will NOT list public documents nor documents which the group is allowed to
  read because it is over another group in the hierarchy. Turned security list
  in ShowDocument into links to ListBy. ListBy also takes ListBy?group=blah
  which will translate blah into a group number.

  Added two new fields for the document display. Author+Institution should be
  obvious. Events (Long Name) gives the description or long name of the event
  instead of the short name.

  The number of characters allowed in event and session descriptions was not
  consistent with what the DB allowed. This has been fixed. (The long
  desciptions are unlimited by the DB, limited to 400 characters by the UI.)

  XML output could contain invalid characters (control characters I suppose)
  which would not parse. These characters should be filtered out.

7.6.0
  New perl modules are required since 7.5.1. Use the scripts/CheckModules
  script to see if you need new ones.

  DocDB 7.6.0 now adds a cross-search feature that will search other DocDB
  installations as long as you have them defined as External DocDBs (see the
  admin pages). Additionally, we will be supplying a DocDB instance that knows
  about as many other instances as possible. So, you may choose not to define
  every other DocDB, just somewhat related ones, but users will still have a
  single place to go if they really want to search everything. The minimum
  version of an external DocDB for this to work is 7.5.1

  Links to this search engine only appear on the homepage if you have other
  DocDBs defined.

  Improved the Group Administer routines with "force option" and better
  reporting.

7.5.2
  Fix some bugs from 7.5.1 with missing requires. Also updated FullList to
  use default settings

7.5.1
  Two new perl modules are required for this release:
  "XML::Twig" and "HTML::TreeBuilder"
  Use the "CheckModules" script to verify installation.

  Added the quick search to the homepage instead of the link to "Search" Link is
  also there as "Advanced"

  Added an XML output version of Search which will be used in the meta-search to
  be added in the version 7.6.0

  Add option for removing all subordinate groups of a group. Otherwise, once
  a subordinate group was set for a group, that group always had to have at
  least one. Also change help to better explain what is going on with groups.

  A somewhat simpler user interface for administering personal account
  (certificates, email notifications. You can still use the old form if you
  know what user you want to act on and what you want to change. But, if you
  click on the person's name in the summary table that follows, you get a
  slightly simpler form for just that one person that (especially) makes adding
  or removing a group easier.

7.5.0
  A new, simpler way to search. Just type in one or more words and DocDB will
  search for them in topics, authors, events, doctypes, and all the text fields.
  Results are ranked by how many matches are found.

  Also on the search form you can type in author names rather than having to
  select them.

  Can now get notification of documents associated with events (just like
  topics, authors, keywords)

  Bold and add ...more information... link to event table even if all events are
  shown. Resulting page shows the end date (if different) and event location.

  Titles of events, sessions, and breaks are now shown on the web pages instead
  of generic "Event," etc. Note that if too much content breaks the layout of
  your header code, you may want to truncate things in that code.

  Link to web page to display break info. Not so useful now, may be later.

  NotifyDigest was very old code and only sent mail on topics (or all documents)
  It was re-written to work use the same criteria as instant notification.

  The DocDB homepage was changed to SourceForge.net

  Better documentation of some tricky things in the API (AddDocument subroutine)
  was added

  A new script, CheckModules was created to check that your Perl installation has
  all the modules required for DocDB

7.4.1
  Put list of events and "notes" in notification e-mail as well as say whether
  document was updated, meta-info updated, files added, document created or
  reserved.

  Remove bolding from authors when there are none in meeting view

  Make sorting order on document update matches order on document view

  Fix bug where user was not reported as being verified after they were

7.4.0
  Changes in the API to allow updating documents and the DB info

  Fix for some edge conditions in the calendar and displaying events

  Users are allowed to rename files that are fetched with wget

  Addition of document notes to fields that can be displayed

  In table view of document, abbreviate filenames longer than 20 characters

  Change first author to first alphabetically and change sort to work on it.

  Fixed a bug in reversing a sorted list of documents

7.3.2
  A couple of bugfixes and one minor display enhancement

  1. When using the certificate version, the view and modify lists were not
  populated correctly for the new document addition form

  2. URLs with port numbers or certain characters could not be uploaded

  3. The list of all events now only lists the most recent 8 events/group. There
  is a link to see all the events.

  4. Behavior for changing the groups a user belongs to has changed. New groups
  selected are added (rather than clearing the list). The complete information
  for a changed user is displayed as a result.

  5. Adding a topic tells the name of the topic, not a number.

  New file:
    cgi/EmailUserHTML.pm

7.3.0
  This release adds the ability to change what information for an agenda or
  document list is displayed in various circumstances. There are two entries
  into the customization form: From the display of an event and from the
  "Preferences" page. Let me know if you think this should be linked from other
  places.

  Ordinary users can set (using cookies) display parameters for anything they
  view which override defaults set by others. Those able to modify an event
  agenda can change the display for that event and admins  can change the
  display for events, groups of events, topics, document types, and various
  system-wide defaults.

  Two other small changes:
    1) Requester is now called "submitter" since the former was confusing
    2) "Restricted to" is now called "Accessible by" when you don't have
       separate view/modify lists (sugested by Stephen P.)

  New files:
    cgi/ConfigSQL.pm
    cgi/CustomListForm
    cgi/EditTalkInfo
    cgi/Fields.pm

  Some CSS class names in meeting agendas have changed, we now have a  class
  name on all cells of document lists and agendas. Using CSS, you can change
  colors, type size, etc., of all these things.

7.2.0

  Both scripts and CSS have changed, make sure you update both

  ***Fixed a directory transversal security issue***
  Improved reporting and interface for AuthorAdd(Form)
  Improved help for meetings
  List of events for the month appear on monthly calendar
  EmailAdministerGroups will clear the list of groups a person belongs to rather
    than add to them if any groups are selected. (Admins can be less careful.)

  Added instructions for getting/importing certificates (courtesy of Lynn
  Garren). There are several new settings to use for this:
    $Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{FNALKCA} = $FALSE;      # TRUE or FALSE - show KCA certificate instructions
    $Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{DOEGrids} = $FALSE;     # TRUE or FALSE - show DOEgrid certificate instructions
    $Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{ShowCertInstructions} = $FALSE;  # TRUE or FALSE - show certificate instructions even on non-cert version
    $secure_root = "https://web-server-host-and-domain/cgi-bin/DocDB/"; URL for secure DocDB in non-secure version
  We've tried to make these instructions generically useful if you have both
  FNALKCA and DOEGrids set to false, as above. In the case where DOEGrids only
  is set, there may be some issues. Please feel free to send patches if you find
  FNAL specific information.

7.1.4

A number of small-ish changes to enhance usability:

1. Fixed automatic association of documents with agenda entries (was severely
broken in v 7.1.3)

2. Files are sorted by description and then file name

3. More blank sessions are added to events in the modify page

4. Whenever an event is shown, the date should also be shown. No need to include
the date in the title

5. There should be a link back to the event groups when an event is viewed

6. When document #s are entered in agendas, a link to that event will appear in
the list of events for a document.

7. Certificate users can change their e-mail

8. The preference $Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{UseCNOnly} has been
removed and this is the default behavior. If you have this in your
ProjectGlobals.pm, you can remove it.

9. The events for a month are shown in the monthly calendar

7.1.1

From a user standpoint, not much is really new. There is a link from the agenda
creation pages to the event documentation. On the list of authors, they are
broken up by last name and if enough authors are entered (>40 currently) there
are anchor links to help find the right author.

On running DocumentAddForm a unique ID is generated which is stored in the
Document table. ProcessDocumentAdd checks that this doesn't exist, so that
reloading the document result form will no longer generate a duplicate
document.

There is a program script/ScriptInstall which can be used to set up DocDB in cgi
areas which link to a central area. This should make setting up a public area
easier, make multiple instances much easier, etc. Just make sure you read the
instructions before using it.

There are also some code cleanups.

7.1.0

This release adds one major function. The "Related Documents" field now accepts
specific versions of documents (123-v4 always links to the 4th version instead
of the latest) and you can also link to versions in *other* DocDB instances. To
do this, you have to make your DocDB aware of other DocDBs with the admin
interface and then use documents like BTeV-140-v1 (the v4 is optional, of
course). This will create a link to the correct BTeV document.

Also, there are instructions for the event organizer and the calendar available.

There were also some bugs fixed along the way and some tweaks made to the event
manager.

7.0.0

Version 7 introduces some new functionality and a lot of clean-ups under the
hood. It also requires a couple of new perl modules. Install this from CPAN or
from RPMs. See cpan.html in doc/ for pointers.  To get these from CPAN, do
this:

> setenv LANG en_US # Get's rid of UTF8 from RedHat
> perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install File::MimeInfo
cpan> install DateTime::Format::MySQL
cpan> install DateTime (probably not needed)

You also have to install the shared-mime-info package. If your system doesn't
have it, you can get it from:

http://freedesktop.org/Software/shared-mime-info

The Fedora Core 2 RPM seems to work fine on Scientific Linux 3.0.x. If you don't
get this installed correctly, RetrieveFile may give the wrong MIME type. In your
webserver error logs you may see messages from DocDB. DocDB will still try to
figure out the MIME type of the files served using the Unix "file" command.

The Document Type (Talk/Figure/etc.) is now changable

Meetings/events (we now try to use the word "events" consistently) are no longer
topics, they are a completely parallel way to organize documents. This
alleviates the presentation problems when the number of events in an event
group (the old special MajorTopics) gets large compared to the number of topics
or when the number of Event Groups gets large. Your existing MajorTopics that
are marked as special in ProjectGlobals will be migrated to the new scheme.

There is now a calendar that shows events. Expect this to improve and grow (and
ask me if you want a pref to turn it off).

There is a directory to store javascript files instead of having the JS we need
printed out by DocDB.

Migration instructions:

0) Back-up your database (do a mysqldump command)
1) Check out the new stable distribution in a fresh area
2) Copy MigrateV7 into an area where you can run *version 6* scripts. The
   cgi-bin will work, but make sure you delete it after you do this to prevent
   it being run from the web.
3) Run MigrateV7 in init mode
4) Run MigrateV7 in migrate mode
5) Upgrade the DocDB code (cvs update -r stable)
6) Go to your html/Static directory and do "cvs update -d -r stable" This will
   create and update a bunch of CSS files as well as create a new "js" directory
   where Javascript files are stored.
7) Edit your site specific CSS files if needed. (There is a new shaded
   element "tbody.Odd" that will be grey by default.)
8) Make sure everything works, make sure your events were migrated correctly.
9) Run  MigrateV7 in delete mode

Links to "Collaboration Meetings" and "Conferences" have been removed from the
homepage. If you would like to put them back ....

New web scripts added: EventAdministerForm
                       ShowCalendar

Version 7 also has tables for future functionality to follow in point releases:

1) Customizing which fields are shown in lists of documents and lists of talks
2) Cross-referencing specific versions of documents and version in *other*
   DocDB's
3) Eliminating people re-loading the document creation form and creating
   duplicate documents.

Finally, the links to Conferences and Collaboration meetings have been removed.
ProjectMessages.pm.template shows how you can restore these or other such lists
for your instance to the DocDB Homepage

6.6.2

There are now basic instructions for the Public (you need to make link to DocDBInstructions in public
instance)

Apply style to DocDBHelp (help popups). Popups have "class=PopUp" and normal
pages have "class=normal" so that you can apply different CSS files to both.

Changed AddDocument API, now returns ($DocumentID,$DocRevisionID). Use
"($DocumentID) = " rather than "$DocumentID = " now. Can also specify Document #
with "-docid => $id"


6.6.0

Two major changes: First, the instructions are now printed with a script rather
than HTML. If you have $HelpFile defined in ProjectGlobals, please remove it,
it is no longer necessary. The instructions will now also include your project
name, point at your URLs, etc. They should not need to be edited.

The second change applies to certificate based authentication only. There is a new
option in the left "menu" of both the main page and the "Change" page that allows a
user to only act as certain groups that they belong to. In other words, if your
certificate lets you act as an administrator and a normal user, you can turn off the
admin abilities until you need them.

6.5.0

In certificate mode or optionally, by setting
$Preferences{Options}{AlwaysRetrieveFile} all files are retrieved via
RetrieveFile which streams the file directly to the user. This has the benefit
of not requiring separate passwords from the user while probably being a little
slower.

6.3.0

By default, certificate authorization uses the e-mail address in a client
certificate to determine if it is unique. Some certificate providers don't
encode an e-mail address. In that case, you can set
$Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{UseCNOnly} = TRUE to use the CN instead.

Also, adds indicators of required fields to the meeting entry form and fixes a
few small bugs discovered by FNAL-CD.

6.2

Allows people with personal accounts to monitor specific documents, not just
based on authors, topics, or keywords. At the bottom of the left column you will
see a place to type your username and password to watch a document. You can
erase the list of watched documents from the "Manage a personal account" page.
When a document you are watching changes, you get e-mail.

6.1

Adds a new field to the document entry and display, cross-references. The user
can type in a space or comma separated list of document numbers, which are then
linked to the document display. A list of documents linking to a displayed
document is also shown.

6.0

This version adds support for client certificates and support for changing the
look-and-feel of DocDB with Cascading Style Sheets.

Upgrading to 6.0 is more difficult than usual, but we hope this will give room
to grow. The general steps are:

1. Edit and run scripts/MigrateV6 to expand the SQL database.
2. Update or check out the new CSS files in html/css and put them in place.
3. Edit ProjectRoutines.pm to match the new format. See the .template file
   for examples
4. Very few users will want to upgrade to certificates, so detailed instructions
   for this will come later.
5. If you have links like "LastModified?days=20" (e.g. in the NavBar) please
   change it to "ListBy?days=20" Also, any ListByType, ListByAuthor,
   ListByTopic links should be changed to just "ListBy" since these routines
   have been consolidated. The old ones are not CSS enabled and will be removed
   in DocDB v 7.0. As a bonus, ListBy is often faster than the routines it
   replaces.
6. Link ListBy to your public site, if you have one.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

  DocDB now uses CSS in some places. Expect this use to grow as well as an
  effort to get DocDB generated content to validate under strict XHTML 1.0.
  When updating DocDB, it will probably be necessary to update the CSS files
  too, or things may not render correctly.

  The biggest impact of this is that now the ShowDocument script will not
  render correctly without CSS. To update for CSS, go to $file_root/Static (in
  the standard setup) and do "cvs update -d". This will create a "css"
  directory with the default CSS files for the installation. You can also
  create CSS files just for your project(s) which are included if they exist so
  you can change the DocDB defaults. See ProjectDocDB.css.example for an
  explanation.

  To accommodate the CSS changes, changes were made to what is expected in
  ProjectRoutines.pm. DocDB now takes care of loading the default CSS files,
  beginning and ending the <HEAD> and the <BODY> and a few other things. There
  are now three hook routines instead of two:

  o ProjectHeader is called at the end of the section of the page between
    <HEAD> and </HEAD> which allows you to include your own CSS (if you don't
    use the mechanism above), Javascript for menus, etc.
  o ProjectBodyStart is called just after the <BODY> tag and allows you to print
    out a header on the page.
  o ProjectBodyEnd is called just before </BODY> and allows you to print a
    footer on the page.

  Take a look at the examples in ProjectRoutines.pm.template. What you used to
  have in DocDBHeader is now expected to be in ProjectHeader and
  ProjectBodyStart, but there are lots of things you don't need either.
  Likewise for DocDBFooter and ProjectBodyEnd. Also, be aware that for pop-ups
  like the keyword chooser, help tips, etc. ProjectHeader will be called, but
  not the other two routines. This allows the style of those windows to be
  consistent with the others without the real estate of headers and
  footers.

  Finally, CSS may allow us to make generic HTML help files too, since I know
  this is an problem.

Client Certificates

  This is a different, more secure method of authenticating users (rather than
  shared group passwords). Access to meta-data and permission to upload files
  requires the user to have a valid client certificate from a CA that you trust.
  The admin interface is used to grant those people membership in the various
  groups in DocDB. Access to files within a document is still controlled by
  group passwords.

  For instructions on setting up a web server to use SSL and require client
  certificates, see http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/apache/SSLNotes.html

5.6.0

New routine to get a report on who needs to sign documents. Linked from various
places. New routine, DocumentTable, to replace DocumentSummary. Has configurable
fields and sort orders, new field added to display next signature needed.

5.5.0

Copying files was not working, so the mechanisms to upload files were scrapped
and completely re-written in a better way. As a consequence, downloading URLs
has been made faster and more secure, but the definition of $WGet has changed in
DocDBGlobals.pm If you changed this in ProjectGlobals.pm, you'll have to change
it to remove all the parameters.

5.4.0

The big change is that in the admin interface, fields that will be ignored based
on the selection of the action (New/Modify/Delete) are greyed out. They are
turned back on as needed. This requires Javascript. Funded by FNAL-CD

There are also the beginnings of an API to allow easier insertation of documents.

5.3.1

Lots of cosmetic changes suggested by FNAL-CD:

Lists of documents now have project name in the header, not in each document #.
Completed (I think) the change from E-mail account to personal account.
Add topic -> Add minor topic
Create/edit meeting links are more explicit.
Things that were in blue text are now in the default color.
Actually styled with class="highlight" which will be a CSS property later.

5.3.0

When updating a document, a user now has the ability to copy files from the
previous document. They can mix uploading some new documents and copying others.
The user will see a checkbox on updating that allows copying the file.

When filling out the new/update document form, the required fields are marked
with an asterisk.

The link to confirm a match between documents and agenda entries has been
changed to a button. This means a web spider won't follow the links and makes it
more clear the user is changing something.


5.2.0

ListManagedDocuments added and a link from the home page. Home page restructured
to add things from ProjectMessages and BTeV/Beams specific code removed.

5.1.3

Send e-mail when a document is approved to everyone who is signed up for
immediate notification and all signers.

5.1.1

To accomodate installations where tar is standard Unix tar (which can't deal
with compressed files) new tar variables have been introduced. $GTar should be
set to GNU's tar (standard tar on Linux). If this doesn't exist, then $Tar
should be set to regular tar and $GZip and $GUnzip to the GNU gzip/gunzip
utilities. The correct defaults for Linux are set in the DocDBGlobals.pm file,
so if you didn't modify these before, you don't need to do anything. If you did
change this and are using GTar, then change your Tar reference to GTar.

Some groups have requested that by default, new documents are marked as
publically accessible. The variable $DefaultPublicAccess, which defaults to "0"
has been added for this. Change it in ProjectGlobals.pm if you want to have
"Public" selected by default instead of the current user when adding a new
document.

I'm starting a new set of settings to determine which parts of the regular
interface are available to the public. The first part of this is the
$PublicAccess{MeetingList} variable, set to 0 by default. Set this to 1 if you
want the "all meetings" item to appear on the public home page. If you do this,
you must also create a link to "ListAllMeetings" in your public directory.

5.1.0

Added new "anyword" and "allword" search modes. Changed keyword link to use
"anyword."

Added an option for external search routines for document contents, added
template files in scripts/ to give examples on use. You must set the
$ContentSearch variable to turn this option on. Look at
scripts/SearchWrapper.template and scripts/ContentSearch.template for examples
of how BTeV does this using htdig.

4.2.6

Removed execution time from various scripts, should advise people to put in
footer (with version). Example placed in ProjectRoutines.pm
